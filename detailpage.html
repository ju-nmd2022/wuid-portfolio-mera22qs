            <p>COMPANY #2: SWEDISH GIN<br>
               In the very north of Sweden,<br> 
               rich in forests,and unspoiled <br>
               nature, two childhood friends <br>
               has for many years produced <br>
               and sold a locally produced <br> 
               Gin at selected Systembolaget<br> 
               stores in northern Sweden.The <br>
               Gin is flavoured with the <br>
               juniper berries from the <br>
               surrounding forests. They have <br>
               never had any proper branding <br>
               for the bottles though, and the<br>
               labels has varied somewhat<br> 
               throughout the years.Now they <br>
               have secured a deal for a larger <br>
               launch throughout Sweden and <br>
               northern Europe and need your <br>
               help coming up with a brand name, <br>
               logo and a visual identity.<br>
               The brand is not exclusive but <br>
               wants to be perceived as clean and <br>
               modern but still close-to-nature.</p>
